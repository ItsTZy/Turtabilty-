Implement a UI upgrade for the durability section editor to replace text-based color point editing with visual controls.

Do not change the underlying section/point data model or config format. This is a UI-only improvement.

Replace the current per-point text row editing with per-point visual controls.

Each color point entry must have:

Percent slider (0–100)

Numeric percent input field synced with slider

Color picker button

Delete point button

Percent slider and numeric input must stay synchronized.

Color picker must update the stored color immediately.

Section UI must allow:

Add color point

Remove color point

Reorder points if needed

Auto-sort points by percent after edits

Add a visual gradient preview bar per section.

The preview bar must:

Render gradient using section color points

Update live when points or colors change

Show percent markers for each point

Keep UI simple and beginner friendly.

Do not add graphs, advanced editors, or complex developer tools.

Use existing config save/load system.

Performance rules:

Do not trigger config save every frame

Only update preview when values change

Do not recalculate color cache here (engine already handles caching)

Compatibility rules:

Must not break existing configs

Must not change section or color point data structure

Must work with existing Cloth Config integration or replace only the per-point widget with custom entries if needed

Do not modify rendering engine logic.
Only modify config UI and editor widgets.
