# Turtabilty-
   Turtabilty is a Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.8 that changes armor color based on durability, with smooth/step/fade   transitions, customizable durability sections, and a simple Cloth Config + Mod Menu setup. It supports per-material   toggles, optional full-durability coloring, single-base-color gradients, and includes a small tribute to Turt.
