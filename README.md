## 🐢 Turtabilty – Armor Durability Visualization

Turtabilty is a **client-side Fabric mod** that provides real-time visual representation of armor durability using percentage-based color mapping.

The mod is designed for **combat awareness and PvP scenarios**, enabling players to visually estimate both their own armor durability and opponent armor durability during gameplay without requiring inventory checks or external damage indicators.

Turtabilty converts armor durability values into configurable percentage ranges and applies color overlays directly to rendered armor models, providing immediate and continuous visual feedback.
